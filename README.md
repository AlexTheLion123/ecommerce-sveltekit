# Ecommerce with Sveltekit

This repo contains a partially completed Ecommerce website built using Sveltekit for the frontend and supabase for the backend and authorization. The integration with Supabase is fully functional; all product information is retreived through specific SQL queries made to the relational tables on Supabase. Also, the authorization works on a basic but secure level with a very basic UI/UX that would not be suitable for production. The authorization code was largely based off of the [Supabase community auth module](https://github.com/supabase-community/auth-helpers/blob/main/packages/sveltekit/README.md).
The payment and cart functionalities have not been implemented.
